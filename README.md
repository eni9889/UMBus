UMBus
=====

You might have used the other Magic bus apps for the iPhone and they are all either inaccurate or just not up to date.

This is the first magic bus app that will constantly be updated and it is the first magic bus app with live streaming route information so you no longer have to reload the app to see new route times.

If you have any suggestions please go to unlimapps.com and comment.
